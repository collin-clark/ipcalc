# ipcalc
A web-based IP Address/Subnet classifier

There are two builds here; one for CGI and one for Flask.

The home page asks for an IP Address and subnet. The subnet can be in dotted-decimal or CIDR notation. The result will provide a plethora
of information; network ID, broadcast, host range, next & previous networks and more.
